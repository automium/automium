    # Introduction
    Cloud Applications need a scalable and resilient infrastructure, not just a Kubernetes cluster that operates containers.
    Automium is responsible for controlling the IaaS below it as well as exposing its own APIs to manage core and extras components described below.

        Service is a core component of Automium. It's the CRD with which the user interacts in order to define a middleware, such as a Kubernetes cluster.
        An example of CR could be the following:
        ```
        apiVersion: core.automium.io/v1beta1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: kubernetes-cluster
          name: mycluster
        spec:
          flavor: e3standard.x4
          replicas: 1
          version: v1.16.4-1-7d8af23e
        ```
        Linked services, such as the described cluster for other node pools, must use the specific environment variable "cluster_name", like in the following example of CR:
        ```
        apiVersion: core.automium.io/v1beta1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: kubernetes-nodepool
          name: mynodepool
        spec:
          env:
          - name: cluster_name
            value: mycluster
          flavor: e3standard.x5
          replicas: 3
          version: v1.16.4-1-7d8af23e
        ```
